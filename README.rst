Mischief
========

This project is a personal Python project, which will become
a swiss army knife for all twitter related utilities, including but
not limited to automated following, unfollowing, cleanup, archiving
of any twitter account. All you need to do is run the script and
and take a sip of your favorite nicotine source.

P.S: After filling in config.py, don't forget to 
"git update-index --assume-unchanged mischief/config.py"
